# springboot-product_management

## Overview

This is a Spring Boot-based Product Management application built with Java. It provides a simple way to manage products, including adding, updating, deleting, and viewing product information.

## How It Works

- **Spring Boot Framework**: The backend uses Spring Boot to create RESTful APIs for product management.
- **CRUD Operations**: You can Create, Read, Update, and Delete products via API endpoints.
- **Data Storage**: Product data is managed in-memory or with a database (check the repository for configuration).
- **API Endpoints**: Interact with the application through HTTP requests using tools like Postman or curl.

### Example Endpoints

- `GET /products` - List all products
- `POST /products` - Add a new product
- `PUT /products/{id}` - Update a product by ID
- `DELETE /products/{id}` - Delete a product by ID

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Syeda-Zynab/springboot-product_management.git
   cd springboot-product_management
   ```

2. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```
   or use your IDE to run the main class.

3. **Use API tools** (like Postman) to interact with the endpoints.

## Project Architecture

The typical structure of the project is as follows:

```
springboot-product_management/
├── src/
│   ├── main/
│   │   ├── java/
│   │   │   └── com/
│   │   │       └── example/
│   │   │           └── productmanagement/
│   │   │               ├── controller/   # REST controllers for endpoints
│   │   │               ├── model/        # Product entity and related models
│   │   │               ├── repository/   # Data access layer
│   │   │               └── service/      # Business logic layer
│   │   └── resources/
│   │       └── application.properties    # App configuration
├── pom.xml                              # Maven configuration
└── README.md
```

- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and maps them to service operations.
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic for product management.
- **Repository Layer**: Interfaces with the database (e.g., using Spring Data JPA).
- **Model Layer**: Represents data structures (e.g., Product).
